# Automated creation of open science and diversity reports

This repository is part of a <a href="https://www.adrianbruegger.com/post/" target="_blank">blogpost</a> that explains how GitHub can be used to automatically generate customised reports. The workflow is explained with respect to open science reports for the journal <a href="https://gep.psychopen.eu" target="_blank">Global Environmental Psychology</a>. These reports are used to verify and document authors' compliance with the journal's open science and diversity policies. Examples of test reports can be found <a href="https://github.com/abruegger/survey_to_customized_reports/tree/main/pdfs/open_science_peer_review" target="_blank">here</a>

The R code to create the reports was developed by Adrian Gadient-Br√ºgger.  Michael Wenger helped to implement the automated creation on git.
