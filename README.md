# Automated creation of open science and diversity reports

This repository is part of a blogpost that explains how GitHub can be used to automatically generate customised reports. The workflow is explained with respect to open science reports for the journal <a href="https://gep.psychopen.eu" target="_blank">Global Environmental Psychology</a>. These reports are used to verify and document authors' compliance with the journal's open science and diversity policies. 

The R code to create the reports was developed by Adrian Gadient-Br√ºgger.  Michael Wenger helped to implement the automated creation on git.
